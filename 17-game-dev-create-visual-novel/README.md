# Game Development

## Create a Visual Novel

## Requirements

Download and install [renpy](https://www.renpy.org/).

## Running it

Open renpy.exe and load up the default game, _The Question_.

## Key Remarks

The game logic and script lies in `scripts.rpy`. Project metadata lives in `options.rpy` and UI specifics are determined by `screens.rpy` and `gui.rpy`.
