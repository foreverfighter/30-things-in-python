# Deep Learning

## Identify Handwritten Digits

## Requirements

We need to install a backend engine. I installed [Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/install.html#install)

```
pip install opencv
pip install numpy
pip install keras
```

If the above fails, you can also try setting up with **Miniconda** or [**Anaconda**](https://www.anaconda.com/).

## Running it

Run the [jupyter notebook](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZ952vChhuI).

## Key Remarks

Similar to the other machine learning tasks, but we have to preprocess the images into numbers, define the model architecture and compile the model before we can use it for training.
