# Google PlacesAPI

## Find details, photos, ratings of a place from the place_ID

## Requirements

```
$ pip install requests
```

Also, register an account, create a project and get your client key, which you should insert into `key.py`.

## Running it

```
$ python snake_details.py
```

Note that normally, you would need to find the `place_ID` first with the Place Search API.
