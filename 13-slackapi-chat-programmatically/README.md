# SlackAPI

## Message and send reactions programmatically

## Requirements

```
pip install slackclient
```

## Setup

Get a slack token(any type will do)(it looks like "xoxb-464951176914-464219741968-LBmNSGVz7dtFTbvi7jef6X2d") and insert it into the code.
Also insert your channel code into the code. You can see it in the url when you're in the channel, like "CDNNYE6QL".

## Running it

```
$ python slackclient_snakes.py
```

## Key Remarks

`sc.api_call()` is how you interact with anything with the SlackClient.
