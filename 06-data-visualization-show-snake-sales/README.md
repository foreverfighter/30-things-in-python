# Data Visualization

## Create a Chart

## Requirements

```
pip install bokeh
```

If the above fails, you can also try setting up with **Miniconda** or [**Anaconda**](https://www.anaconda.com/).

## Running it

Run the [jupyter notebook](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZ952vChhuI).

## Key Remarks

We create the plot with `p = figure()`, then each bar is a _glyph_ that we create with `p.vbar()`.
