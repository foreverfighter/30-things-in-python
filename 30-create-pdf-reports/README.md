# Weekly data insights report

We will generate a weekly data insights report.

## Workflow

1.  Open `report.py`.
2.  Change the report date in the file. Use the date of the Friday of that week.
3.  Visualise your data in Google Sheets or Bokeh or whatever.
4.  Take screenshots and save them in this folder.
5.  Write your insights and the filenames of the screenshots for each insight.
6.  `$ python report.py`
7.  Retrieve your PDF from the created folder.
