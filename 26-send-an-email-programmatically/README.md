# Email

## Send email programmatically

## Requirements

None!

Just fill in your login details in `login.py`. If you're using gmail, make sure you get an app-specific password [here](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords).

Also, fill in the _from_ and _to_ email addresses.

## Running it

```
$ python send-email.py
```
